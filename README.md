# A2D2: Summer in the City


## Who is Summer in the City and what do they do?

Summer in the City is a nonprofit organization based in Detroit that works to bring a diverse group of volunteers together to address the immediate needs of the city through “Paint, Plant, and Play”- activities like creating murals, building and maintain urban gardens, and hosting youth enrichment programs. Volunteers meet up at one of several carpool sites throughout Southeast Michigan to head into the city.

## What data are they providing?

Summer in the City has data on volunteers and daily logistics from summer 2014. The data is in two formats: CSV files and SQLite database files.

## What do they want?

Through our help, SITC wants to better understand how to recruit more volunteers, specifically by learning the best spots to set up car pools and host fundraising activities. SITC would also like to explore the following things:

- Identifying impact factors. For example, how can they tally volunteer hours every day?
- How can they aggregate information at the end of each summer?
- Identifying ways to bring potential volunteers to carpool sites
- Identifying high schools where fundraising activities and volunteer recruitment can be held
- Getting advice on data collection and data management strategy going forward.
